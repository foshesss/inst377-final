We engage the complexities of an individual, who articulated a moral compass of the nation, to explore racial justice in post-World War II America. This course gives special attention to King's post-1965 radicalism when he called for a reordering of American society, an end to the war in Vietnam, and supported sanitation workers striking for better wages and working conditions. Topics include King's notion of the \"beloved community\", the Social Gospel, liberalism, \"socially conscious democracy\", militancy, the politics of martyrdom, poverty and racial justice, and compensatory treatment. Primary sources form the core of our readings.",

While eclectic in selection, our examination of these films will be oriented around a pair of questions. What is antiblackness and how does cinema encounter, contemplate, and critique it? How do different geographies and historical experiences shift cultural and political concerns, as well as the methods of cinema along with those differing concerns? Such questions will allow us to see how questions of antiblackness and Black life operate in the between and overlapping spaces of colonial experience, ghettoization, and sites of resistance, rebellion, and radicalism.",

We will begin with exploration of historical influences such as the role of African culture on contemporary African American norms of expressivity and the role of antebellum slavery, the eugenics movement, and blackface on stimulating contemporary stereotypes about African American emotional temperament (e.g., stereotypes regarding aggressiveness, anger, and violence). We will conclude with discussions of the impact of discrimination on emotional and physiological reactivity and factors that promote emotional resiliency. The course materials will require students to grapple with the contemptuous disconnect between the African American cultural tradition of free emotional expressivity and the survival strategy to control emotions in response to a society threatened by Black emotionality.",

This advanced course, then, will introduce students to the study and practice of Asian American cyktyre as multiple , hybrid, and heterogeneous. It will do so through three sections: section one will introduce students to classical, cultural, and media concepts as well as relevant keywords outlined by Asian American Studies scholars; section two will review the work of Asian American cultural theorists; section three will focus on analyses of particular Asian American cultural productions. In doing so, students will gain an understanding of the shifting and interlocking tensions among the local, the national, and the global that form the cultural geographies of Asian America.",

It covers the history of racial, gendered, and sexualized representations of Asian Americans in Hollywood, as well as Asian American filmic responses within and outside Hollywood. It also introduces how four basic tools of film analysis mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing and sound work together to create meaning in moving images. It examines how these elements are put together in three different types of films by Asian American filmmakers: narrative, documentary, and experimental. How films function in society to circulate ideas that reproduce and challenge stereotypes about Asian Americans.",

These systems are inherently complex, owing to their (typically) high dimensionality and nonlinearity.  Hence, their exact solutions are difficult (if at all feasible) to obtain.    Consequently, these systems are generally studied using a combination of asymptotic analysis and numerical discretization approaches.  This course will cover a broad spectrum of techniques, theories and tools for modeling and analysing real-life phenomena arising in population biology, with emphasis on the study and asymptotic analysis of general classes of unstructured (single species discrete-time and continuous-time models, interacting populations etc.) and structured (spatially-structured, age-structured, sex-structured) population biology models arising in ecology and epidemiology.",

This course gives special attention to King's post-1965 radicalism when he called for a reordering of American society, an end to the war in Vietnam, and supported sanitation workers striking for better wages and working conditions. Topics include King's notion of the \"beloved community\", the Social Gospel, liberalism, \"socially conscious democracy\", militancy, the politics of martyrdom, poverty and racial justice, and compensatory treatment. Primary sources form the core of our readings.",

Through readings, film clips, and presentations, we will explore how the concept of race has developed and endured over time and become familiar with key concepts, such as \"race\" and \"intersectionality\". We will attempt to better understand how race is associated with other forms of difference, such as class, gender and ethnicity. We will identify and confront the prevailing myths about race and ethnicity in the United States. Finally, we examine the ways in which contemporary issues reveal the dynamics of race and ethnicity.",

It examines how these elements are put together in three different types of films by Asian American filmmakers: narrative, documentary, and experimental. How films function in society to circulate ideas that reproduce and challenge stereotypes about Asian Americans.",

The initial run of this course will focus on the 1856 project at the University of Maryland, which focuses on three main areas of Black Life at and around the University of Maryland - Slavery and the Building of the Campus; Civil Rights, Black Student Activism, and the University; and the Relationship of the University to its Black Neighbors.",
